This is the July 09th 2023 Digital Platform update.

The main focus of this update is clearing all outstanding fixes/adjustments and the content team more independent by leveraging new features of some of the frameworks the platform is built on.

## 0.0 – The new _Pages (play)_ collection

In the past, the content of pages of [play.ootiboo.com](https://play.ootiboo.com/) was managed in separate Strapi single content type entries. As a result, adding new pages required setting up a new content type for the new page's content along with a code template to render it on the frontend, both tasks which the content team cannot realise independently.

This bottleneck has been resolved by creating a new content collection labeled _Pages (Play)_, which provides a flexible blueprint (sets of content fields) for all its entries with which every required page layout can be created. All required/possible page elements (text, images, galleries, forms, ...) have been implemented as dynamic content blocks with which a page can be filled. With the new _Pages (Play)_ collection new pages can be created and added to the frontend without any coding required.

The only mandatory content fields to be populated when creating a new page are its _Title_ and _Slug_.

## 0.1 – Linking pages

Furthermore, pages of the _Pages (play)_ collection can be linked with one another, based on a parent-child relationship model.

A page can be set to be either another page's parent or child/subpage. Pages linked to a page as subpages will be made accessible on the frontend with a dynamically rendered subpage switch. A page may have multiple children but only one parent.

## 1.0 – Editing of text content

To eliminate a source of error and provide a more comfortable and efficient editing experience, using HTML tags in Strapi text content fields has been disabled. HTML tags may be malformed (causing problems during the rendering of frontend pages) and are cumbersome to write.

From here on, text content should be formatted/styled using the Markdown syntax which is fully supported by both the Strapi text editor and the frontend rendering engine. All common ways in which you might want to format some text are available through the interface of the text editor:

- **Bold**
- _Italics_
- <u>Underlined</u>
- [Links](https://play.ootiboo.com/) 
- Lists:
	- List Item A
	- List Item B
	- List Item C

	1. List Item 1
	2. List Item 2
	3. List Item 3

Alternatively, you can directly type the characters for text styling, according to the Markdown language. A list of all available formats and how they need to be typed can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

Note: Using HTML tags in a text field will result in the tags being rendered as plain text.

## 2.0 New content blocks

### New _Headline_ block

To comply with Google's recommendations for good search engine optimisation, a new headline block component has been added to Strapi. It is labeled _Block Headline (Proto)_ to separate it from the old _Block Headline_ which will eventually be removed from the dynamic content block library. 

The new headline block features a _Level_ option with which the HTML heading tag wrapped in which the headline is going to be rendered, can be set. By default, the headline level is set to _h2_ (a medium-sized headline). Each page should contain exactly one _h1_-level headline.

In addition to the _Level_ option, the new headline block feature a _Syle_ option which can be set to either _default_ or _block_. Leaving it as _default_ will render a regular headline, setting it to _block_ will render a headline inside of a colored block.

### New _Card Grid_ block

The new Card Grid block allows you to add a grid of cards to a page.

![[07-09-2023-08-new-card-grid-block-preview.png]]
The block features two settings: the block's _Width_ and the grid's _Columns_. The _Width_ option determines the block’s width across the page (_regular_ = the block is as wide as regular text content, _full_ = the block spans the entire width of the page towards the right page edge). _Columns_ sets the amount of columns the grid will be displayed with (on large enough screens).

Cards are created as items of the block and can be filled with a title, a short text and an image. A card can also be turned into a link by either linking the card to an internal works.ootiboo or play.ootiboo page or providing a link to an external web page (must be a full, valid URL).

### New _automatic Card Grid_ block

The _automatic Card Grid_ block allows you to add a grid of cards based on an existing content collection. The block automatically generates cards from content stored in the entries of the collection you choose.

![[07-09-2023-10-new-autom-card-grid-block-preview.png]]
With the block's _Required collection_ field, a content collection is selected to generated the cards from.

Note: Currently only the _Team Members_, _Partners_ and _Contributors_ collection are available for this block. The remaining collections will be integrated in a future update.

Alongside the _Width_ and _Columns_ option, the autom. card card grid allows you to set the _Page Limit_, limiting how many cards will be displayed at once. If the linked collection has more entries than the page limit, a pagination element (numbered bullets/buttons) will be displayed below the grid, allowing the user to navigate the grid.

Furthermore, the block has a _With filter bar_ option. When enabled, a list of buttons is displayed above the grid with which the cards can be filtered. The buttons are generated from the tags collection selected with the _Filter bar categories_ field.

## 3.0 – Frontend fallbacks

The provide a more robust framework for handling errors on the frontend, a fallback instance has been set up for all three main frontend applications, [play.ootiboo.com](), [works.ootiboo.com]() and [teachers.ootiboo.com](). These instances run the last fully functional and tested version of the respective frontend and can be turned on in case something has broken the regular frontend. This allows taking the necessary steps to fix any issues without causing either of the website to go offline or display an error.

Note: The fallback applications do not automatically update when content is Strapi is changed. Instead, they are updated manually in regular intervals to the most recent version of all content after it has been ensured that the content is save and does not cause any errors.
