## 🚀 New Features 🚀

### Automatic link from event card to project

Because events can now be linked to projects via the new relation field, it is no longer necessary to link an event’s card to the related project through the _Link to internal or external page_ field.

❗️Important: The _Link to internal or external page_ field can still be used in case a card should link to an internal page that is not a project or an external page. When linking to an __internal page__, please use the page’s slug, __not it’s full URL__.

## ✂️ Revisions ✂️

### Event-Project relations

An implementation of the previous update needs to be reversed: An event can not longer be linked to multiple projects; allowing an event to be linked to more than one project creates conflict when generating the event cards, as a cards function as links and a link can only ever lead to a single target. A project however may still be linked to multiple events.

## 🛠️ Fixes 🛠️

### Custom event registration button text on event cards

A bug has been fixed which caused the custom event registration button text of _Dates & Events_ entries to not be displayed on the event cards on the _Dates & Events_ overview page.

### Event end-date field update

The _End date_ of _Dates & Events_ entries has been reported to not update upon changing and saving it in Strapi. I have tested the field on my end and can confirm that it is working, see the video below. This might have been a one-time malfunction of Strapi. If the problem occurs again, please try [contacting me right away](https://ootiboo.slack.com/team/U029Z8Q3SRM) to we can investigate the issue.
