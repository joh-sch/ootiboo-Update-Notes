### Allowing event registrations from within project pages

Event registrations are currently only possible via the registration buttons on cards of the _Dates & Events_ page. Before making them available on project pages, we need to resolve the question of how these registrations should be processed.

Registrations need to be saved to the database. Currently, they are associated and saved to the entries of the _Dates & Events_ collection. If registrations are to be submittable on project pages, we need to discuss and decide how to create a relation between an event/date (for which registrations can be submitted) and a project.

I suggest the following system: 

- We enable linking projects and events via a relations field. 
- If a project is linked to an event and this event can be registered for, the project‚Äôs card and page will display a registration button
- If a registration is submitted via a project card or page, the registration is saved to the linked event entry (not the project entry)

## üöÄ New Features üöÄ

### Scrollable dropdown menu

Instances of the dropdown menu component with a long list of options, (such as a dropdown for selecting a school from the list of all registered ootiboo schools), become unusable beyond a certain number of options, depending on the size of the user‚Äôs screen.

  controls="controls" 
  style   ="max-width: 100%;">

To solve this issue, a scrollable menu has been implemented. It‚Äôs height is limited, preventing if from extending beyond the bottom of the screen and allowing the user to scroll through the available options.

### Event registration notifications

An email and slack notification after a successful event/workshop registration has been implemented.

The notification emails are send to:

goose@ootiboo.com
amanda@ootiboo.com
info@ootiboo.com

Slack notifications will appear in a new channel labeled _platform-event-registrations_:

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Revisions ‚úÇÔ∏è

### Revised event registration form

Layout and functionality of the event registration form have been revised. 

The form no longer displays the selected event‚Äôs date. Above the first name, last name and email field, it now features a dropdown field labelled _School_, from which any of the schools signed up with ootiboo can be selected. All other fields remain inactive until a school as been selected.

![02-revised-event-reg-form-layout](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/aaaad01b-848b-4526-9b9b-65bf70f24bfb)

Correspondingly, a _School_ field has been added to the data model for event registrations in Strapi, in which the selected school‚Äôs name will be stored upon submission.

To enable easy editing of the info text displayed in the form‚Äôs header and footer, a new entry has been added to the _Forms_ collection in Strapi. The entry's _Text_ and _Call-To-Action_ fields correspond to the form‚Äôs header and footer text respectively.
