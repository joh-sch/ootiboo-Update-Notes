This is the August 29th 2023 ootiboo Digital Platform update.

<br>

## ‚ùó Important notices ‚ùó

### ice-cream.ootiboo.com teacher sign-up

Sign-ups by teachers from non-UK schools are not possible yet as a separate database table needs to be set up to collect them. This will follow in another update shortly.

### ice-cream.ootiboo.com language switch

Due to some complications with NextJs, the underlying application framework, the language switch button on the ice-cream.ootiboo.com pages sometimes does not link to the correct page when attempting to switch the language. I'm investigating and working on a fix.

## üöÄ New Features üöÄ

### ice-cream.ootiboo.com

A new instance of the digital platform app has been set up under the subdomain ice-cream.ootiboo.com.
#### ice-cream.ootiboo.com pages

Creating and editing pages for ice-cream.ootiboo.com works just as it does for play.ootiboo.com, but pages are managed in a separate Strapi collection labelled Pages _(Ice Cream)_.

Two page entries, the home-/frontpage and the _About Us_ page, have been set up to get you started.

![04-ice-cream-pages-collection](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/5730aba4-7cc8-45ba-bdb3-ebade80e5b21)

<br>

#### ice-cream.ootiboo.com projects

ice-cream.ootiboo.com has its own dedicated projects collection in which to create, edit and manage project pages to be shown on the ootiboo Ice-Cream site.

The collection is labelled _Projects (Ice Cream)_. Entries of this collection work just as regular project entries do but won't show up on play.ootiboo.com/projects. Some older fields which are part of the regular _Projects_ model (to preserve some legacy content), such as the _Show in ootiboo skills?_ and _Show in Kids version_, have been excluded from this new collection as they no longer apply.

An empty project entry for _Ice Cream: Svalbard_ has been set up to get you started.

![05-ice-cream-projects-collection](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/6002c4ec-2775-4e33-9d53-3c26345330fb)

<br>

#### ice-cream.ootiboo.com navigation/menu

Links inside the navigation menu of ice-cream.ootiboo.com are managed in a separate entry inside the _Menus_ collection.

<br>

#### ice-cream.ootiboo.com multi language content

Pages and projects of ice-cream.ootiboo.com can be edited in both English and German. To switch the version you're editing, use the _Locales_ selector in Strapi.

![07-ice-cream-locale-selection](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/0930320f-d559-474f-b92e-7778763046b4)

<br>

### Automatic link from event card to project

Because events can now be linked to projects via the new relation field, it is no longer necessary to link an event‚Äôs card to the related project through the _Link to internal or external page_ field.

![01-manual-project-link-field-deprecated](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/754acf8c-09a5-4aec-9fb3-56a8675d1034)

<br>

‚ùóÔ∏èImportant: The _Link to internal or external page_ field can still be used in case a card should link to an internal page that is not a project or an external page. When linking to an __internal page__, please use the page‚Äôs slug, __not it‚Äôs full URL__.

![02-event-internal-link-warning](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/0b44138f-0bb2-481a-af53-d98e7212f652)

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Revisions ‚úÇÔ∏è

### Event-Project relations

An implementation of the previous update needs to be reversed: An event can not longer be linked to multiple projects; allowing an event to be linked to more than one project creates conflict when generating the event cards, as a cards function as links and a link can only ever lead to a single target. A project however may still be linked to multiple events.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes üõ†Ô∏è

### Custom event registration button text on event cards

A bug has been fixed which caused the custom event registration button text of _Dates & Events_ entries to not be displayed on the event cards on the _Dates & Events_ overview page.

![00-fixed-custom-btn-text-on-event-card](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/aa65de89-f8a8-4208-aaf5-b36a99f50e9a)

<br>

### Event end-date field update

The _End date_ of _Dates & Events_ entries has been reported to not update upon changing and saving it in Strapi. I have tested the field on my end and can confirm that it is working, see the video below. This might have been a one-time malfunction of Strapi. If the problem occurs again, please try [contacting me right away](https://ootiboo.slack.com/team/U029Z8Q3SRM) to we can investigate the issue.
