## ðŸš€ New Features ðŸš€

### Dyn. project page subpage tabs

#### Overview
play.ootiboo.com project pages are layed out according to the following structure:

![00-project-page-arch-diagram](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/26c9c78b-1d65-4f10-b64d-0f7104c19f52)


Until now, content of project tabs/subpages had to be added (in the form of content blocks) to one of the predefined content sections available in the corresponding Strapi content type:

- *Jump In*
- *Share*
- *Gallery*
- *Competition*
- *Map*

Along with the content blocks in either one of these sections, an entry in the project's _Subpage links_ field had to be created with a slug that matches the slug of one of the predefined sections:

- play.ootiboo.com/projects/some-project/ (_Jump in_ is the main page, indicated by a forward slash, hence it has no actual slug)
- play.ootiboo.com/projects/some-project/share
- play.ootiboo.com/projects/some-project/gallery
- play.ootiboo.com/projects/some-project/competition
- play.ootiboo.com/projects/some-project/map

#### Creating dynamically named tabs

To allow for more freedom when creating, naming and populating a project page's tabs with content, a new system has been implemented which makes it possible to add up to five dynamically named tabs. 

The predefined tabs and their content sections remain available. Below the last one (the Â»MapÂ« content section), you'll find five new content sections, each simply labelled _dynamic subpage/tab \#X_.

![01-fixed-and-dyn-project-tab-content-sections](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/810a84f5-1e06-4ee5-a966-e64093ccb95b)


To create a new, dynamically named tab, a _Dyn. Section ID_ block must first be added to one of the (still empty) dyn. tab sections. This block makes it possible for the siteâ€™s frontend to associate the blocks of this section with a corresponding subpage link (the button in the tab bar, more on this later).

Create a _Dyn. Section ID_ block and fill itâ€™s _ID_ field with **the slug of the tab/subpage** you'd like to create. The slug is the last part of the URL which opens a project page on a specific tab and should be derived from the title of the tab you're creating.

![03-create-section-id-block](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/aa26edc3-6f33-4e08-9c7f-6cd00386260a)

Lastly, a link leading to this tab must be added to the _Subpage links_ field. This field is responsible for rendering the buttons in a project pageâ€™s tab bar; for each link/button, it must know where it is supposed to lead to when click. Remember that to each tab/subpage belongs a specific URL ending in it's slug.

Just like with the predefined tabs, an entry must be added for any dynamic tabs; the link text can be anything you like but the slug must match the value used as the ID in the _Dyn. Section ID_ block.

![05-create-dyn-tab-link](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/ff8cdc1e-833e-4452-8555-c8b10bc3e3dc)


A tab button with the text used in the link entry will now be displayed on the given project page. Clicking it will lead to a subpage of this project page with a URL ending in the tabâ€™s slug and whatever content blocks you've added in the tab's content section will be rendered below the tab bar (except for the _Dyn. Section ID_ block).
