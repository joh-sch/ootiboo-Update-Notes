## üöÄ New Features üöÄ

### Hiding language switch buttons on scroll

In the app‚Äôs desktop version, when scrolling downwards on a page, the language switch buttons now hide (move upwards out of view) to match the behavior of the _Teachers_ buttons.

### Link groups for desktop navigation menu

To fully implement the design proposed for the desktop version‚Äôs navigation menu on ice-cream.ootiboo.com (in which the menu links are grouped and visually separated by a bottom margin), a new _Link Groups_ field has been added to the blueprint/model of the _Menus_ collection in Strapi. 

If entered as groups (i.o. as a simple list of links in the _Links_ field above), links will be rendered grouped and separated on the frontend. Groups should be given a title along with the list of links they are to contain; the title is not displayed on the frontend but helps to manage the groups in Strapi. 

All links will be rendered regularly in the mobile version‚Äôs menu.

### Customising registration form content for each event

To allow a more flexible customisation of the text content displayed in the event registration form, a new field labelled _Registration form content_ has been integrated into the blueprint/model of entries of the _Dates & Events_ collection.

It provides the following sub-fields:

- ___Headline___ ‚Äî The headline displayed at the top of the form
- ___Header text___ ‚Äî The text above the form fields
- ___Footer text___ ‚Äî The text below the form fields

If left empty, the form will default to:

___Headline___ 
Register Interest

___Header text___
You are registering interest in the following project: PROJECT TITLE

___Footer text___
The ootiboo team will contact you via email to make arrangements. If your school is not part of ootiboo yet then sign up for free, then return here to register.

### Hyphenation of card headlines

Hyphenation has been disabled for headlines of cards; hyphenation of headlines is uncommon in English and hence should be avoided.
