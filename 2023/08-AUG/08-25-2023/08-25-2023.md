## üöÄ New Features üöÄ

### Event registration via project pages

This is a follow up to the August 21st 2023 update. As discussed, the event registration system has been extended, allowing users to register for events on a project page if the project is linked to an event.

To enable this functionality, entries of both the _Projects_ and the _Dates & Events_ collection feature a new relations field with which entries of these collections can be linked/associated with each other. If a project is linked to an event and this event can be registered for, the project‚Äôs page will display a registration button. An event can be linked to multiple projects and vice versa.

To make communication with the user more clear, the text of the registration button can be edited with the new _Registration button text_ field. A button for each linked event will be rendered in the information column on the right-hand side of the project page.

### Event type field

To distinguish different types of events, the blueprint/model of entries of the _Dates & Events_ collection now features a _Event type_ field. To make this option as flexible as possible, it is implemented as a text field rather than a drop-down with a fixed set of options.

### Manual order of project filter buttons

To enable a manual order of filter buttons generated from tags on the projects overview page, the _Priority_ field has been implemented for entries of the _Tags (Projects)_ collection. To move a filter button to the front of the list, give it's corresponding tag a higher priority.

### Children‚Äôs University button & info pop up on project pages

Similar to the National Curriculum, projects marked as _Children‚Äôs University_ projects will now display a button in the _Further Information_ section, which when clicked opens up a pop-up with additional information. The information is to be added in a new field of the project blueprint/model labelled _Info Text ‚Äì Children‚Äôs University_. The button is only clickable if an info text has been entered.
