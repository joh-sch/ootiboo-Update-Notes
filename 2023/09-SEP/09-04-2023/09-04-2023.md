## üöÄ New Features üöÄ

### Project submission form _For schools & Families_ and _For Individuals_

A switch button has been implemented into the project submission form to allow switching between different versions of the form. This feature makes it possible to hide/show field which are applicable/not applicable to the type of user uploading a submission.

‚ùóImportant: It still needs to be discussed and decided in which way these versions of the form should differ. At the moment, only the _School_ field is hidden when switching to the _For individuals_ version. Please use the Development List to comment on this matter.

### _No. Students_ card for teacher/school dashboard

The _Students_ card on the _Profile_ page of the teacher dashboard has been re-implemented to simply display the number of students of a given school account. The value displayed in the card corresponds to the _No. pupils_ field of the school blueprint/model.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Revisions ‚úÇÔ∏è

### Revised Project Page Layout

The project page layout of the app‚Äôs desktop version has been revised to resolve layout inconsistencies emerging due to the content structure of projects diverging from the one the layout had originally been design around.

Not all projects feature introductory content long enough to sufficiently fill the space below the page's headline, resulting in large areas of white space between the page‚Äôs header and it‚Äôs content area. This occurs because the page‚Äôs sidebar on the right grows vertically and pushes the content area downward, away from the page header.

To resolve this, header, content area and sidebar have been completely separated into stand alone components.

### Deprecated _Intro Images_ field (project pages)

Because editing and managing content of project pages has been proven to be easier and more efficient using dynamic content blocks, the _Intro Images_ field has been removed from the project page blueprint. It had previously been used to create a slideshow in the page‚Äôs header at a fixed position; going forward, the content team will use the _Gallery_ content block in the page‚Äôs main dynamic area to create slideshows at the top of project pages if needed.

### Correct logo image for international.ootiboo.com

The logo image previously used on international.ootiboo.com has been replaced with the same image used on play.ootiboo.com (without _play_ tagline beneath)
