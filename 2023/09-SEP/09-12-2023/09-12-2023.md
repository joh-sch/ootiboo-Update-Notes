## üöÄ New Features üöÄ

### _Team Members (international)_ collection

To enabling displaying of separate team member information, both in a grid on the _Our Team_ overview page (subpage of _About Us_) and on the individual team member pages on international.ootiboo.com, a separate Strapi collection labelled _Team Members (international)_ as been created.

<br>

Entries of this collection work the same way as entries of the _Team Members (works)_ collection. To display them in a grid, create a _Card Grid (auto.)_ block on any of the _Pages (international)_ entries (such as _Our Team_) and set its _Required collection_ to _Team Members (international)_.

### _News & Events_ items to be displayed on play.ootiboo.com by default

The _Show in ootiboo play?_ toggle field of entries of the _News & Events_ collection has been configured to be set to true by default. The content team had previously missed setting the field leading to articles intended for play.ootiboo to not be displayed. By changing the default value, any new articles will automatically be displayed on play.ootiboo.com unless explicitly told not to.
