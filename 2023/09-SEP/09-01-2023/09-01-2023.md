## üöÄ New Features üöÄ

### _Project Material List_ as a dyn. block

The Project Material List component has been implemented as a dynamic block. 

Previously, the component had been rendered in a fixed position as part of the project page layout; because of our evolving, more flexible approach to page layouts, it can now be used as a dynamic block anywhere on the project page. 

![04-new-project-material-list-block](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/bd4ba577-4a21-462a-814b-494ed55b7d5d)

<br>

The block is available in all dynamic areas of the project blueprint. It features a _Title_ field (for easier management, title will be displayed on the collapsed block element in Strapi), a _Width_ field (render block at regular width or across the entire width of the page) and an _Items_ field. The _Items_ field is mandatory and must be populated with at least on entry.

### New _Tip_ content block

To allow for more flexible labelling of the _Teacher Tip_ content block, it has been re-implemented as the more generic _Tip_ content block. It is available in all dyn. areas of the project blueprint and the ootiboo play/international pages blueprint.

![07-new-tip-content-block](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/7149c211-19f2-44cc-a9de-709339567c71)

<br>

The block features a new _Label_ field, the content of which will be displayed above its text content (previously the label text had been fixed to always read ¬ªTeacher Tip¬´).

### Revised Slider component implemented for project resource previews

The Slider component has been re-implemented to display project resource previews as part of the _Downloads_ content block. If preview images are available, clicking the preview icon/button will open up a full screen slider showing the preview images.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Revisions ‚úÇÔ∏è

### Global _Projects_ collection

Instead of managing projects for international.ootiboo.com in a separate Strapi collection, the system has been reverted to house all projects in a single, global projects collection. There is no actual need for a separate collection since all content fields required by projects to be displayed on international.ootiboo.com are already included in the existing _Projects_ collection

Projects can be configured to be displayed on play.ootiboo.com and/or international.ootiboo.com via the corresponding toggle fields at the top of the blueprint. A new _Show in ootiboo international?_ field has been added.

![01-is-international-field](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/6e81b614-c22b-4df3-ab25-de18e7e6cb5a)

<br>

### Removal of deprecated content fields from project blueprint

Some content fields which are not longer needed have been removed from the _Projects_ blueprint/model:

- _Show in ootiboo skills_ (skills.ootiboo is no longer active)
- _Show in Kids verions_ (kids.ootiboo.com is no longer active)
- _Show in ootiboo works_ (projects are not intended to be displayed on works.ootiboo)

![00-deprecated-project-fields](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/541995b9-38ab-4864-bf2b-6d4cb246b8d4)

<br>

### Additional call-to-action text on event cards

The call-to-action texts _Please register for this event._ has been removed from the event card layout as its no longer needed (registration button is sufficient).

![02-text-removed-from-event-card](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/0c4971a7-fe62-4d03-9b34-e62afc9dbf22)

<br>

### Default event type for event registration email/slack notification 

The template for event and slack notifications sent out after an event registration have been revised to show _Interest_ as the event type in case no event type has been specified in the event Strapi entry.

![03-specify-event-type](https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/17d0a897-b798-469b-bb4a-4f9390eeb4b7)
