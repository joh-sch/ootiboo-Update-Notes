## ✂️ Revisions ✂️

### Default site image for international.ootiboo.com

The _Site Settings_ content type has been extended, it now includes a field for a default site preview image to be used for all pages of international.ootiboo.com which have not been assigned their own preview image (via the SEO field at the bottom of the page blueprint).

### Correct navigation menu link highlighting on initial page load

The mobile and desktop navigation components have been revised in order to correctly highlight the menu link of the initially loaded page, e.g. *play.ootiboo.com/projects*. 

Previously, link highlighting kicked in only once the user clicked on a menu link for the first time. But as the first page loaded might not necessarily be the frontpage (in which case no link highlighting is necessary), the link corresponding to the page first loaded should be highlighted.

## 🛠️ Fixes 🛠️

## Missing page-level meta image

A bug, which caused some page-specific meta data to not be picked up and displayed by the frontend, has been fixed.

## 🧹 Cleanup 🧹

### Streamlined project blueprint

Most page content, be it on regular pages such as those of the _Pages (play)_ and _Pages (international)_ collection or on more specialised pages such as project pages, is added in the form of content blocks. Blocks make it easy and efficient to realise diverse page layouts. 

To continue this adoption of content blocks as the main method for adding and editing content, the static text fields _Intro Paragraph_ and _Intro Text_ have been removed from the project blueprint/model. All content previously existing in either one of these fields has been moved into a text block of the respective project’s main page.

### Codebase cleanup

Various deprecated data formatting utilities have been removed from the codebase, making it more concise and easier to maintain. These utility functions had previously been used to convert certain data structures into data consumable by the application’s frontend but are no longer needed as data structures (especially of page and project data) have since been streamlined and unified.
