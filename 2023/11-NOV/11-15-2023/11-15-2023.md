### All Star submissions collection

A new collection type to store submissions to the _All Star_ project has been set up. An entry of this collection features the same content fields as entries of the _ootibOO!_ submission collection.

To connect an Upload Form block to the collection (i.e. have entries be uploaded to the collection via the form), use `submissions-all-star` as the form‚Äôs submission API endpoint.

### Project Submission Form: Newsletter Sign-up checkbox

The project submission form now includes a checkbox field asking the user if they'd like to be signed up to the newsletter. If checked, the sign-up will be triggered after all entries currently in the field have successfully been submitted. The field is unticked by default.

### Subpage-/Tab-specific meta data for projects

The meta data of project pages for better SEO can now be specified for each of a project page's subpages (= tabs) individually.

To do so, in Strapi simply create an SEO content block anywhere in the dynamic content section corresponding to the subpage/tab you'd like to add meta data for. Like the meta data for pages, the block features three fields:

- Title
- Description
- Image

All fields are optional. If left empty, the corresponding value of the parent page‚Äòs meta data (= the project page) or of the default meta data will be used, depending on which is available.

Since the block is not being visually rendered on the frontend, it does not matter where in the order of blocks of a section it sits. Placing and keeping it at the end of all blocks makes the most sense.

### Improved project submission form: Automatic assignment of submissions to projects

The project submission form has been improved by implementing the automatic assignment of entries to the project on the page of which they have been submitted. This reduces the overhead of managing submissions as the project relation field of an entry does no longer have to be set manually by the team. This caused confusion recently, as submissions had not been displayed in the gallery of small projects despite having been uploaded, reviewed and published.

### Broken project card badge layout

During a partial automatic re-build of the project overview page (play.ootiboo.com/projects) triggered by a re-ordering of the projects, the CSS classnames responsible for aligning the CU and NC badge elements displayed on project cards got mixed up by the server, causing badges on two card elements to be in the wrong position and be rendered too small + with the wrong background.

This has been fixed by manually forcing a full rebuild.
