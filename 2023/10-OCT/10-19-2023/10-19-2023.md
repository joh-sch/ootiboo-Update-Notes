### Pop-up notification for users switching from German international.ootiboo.com to teachers.ootiboo.com

For a more coherent user experience for people (teachers) using the German version of international.ootiboo.com, a pop-up has been implemented which will open upon a German user clicking on the _Sign-up_ button of the teachers menu. The pop-up displays an info text, letting the user know that they are leaving the German version of ootiboo and are being redirected to the English-only (for now) teachers.ootiboo.com. The user can then decide to continue or to cancel the action.

The info text as well as the pop-upâ€™s headline can be edited in a new collection labelled _Pop-up Settings_.

### German language content for _Teachers_ menu

To fully integrate the German version of international.ootiboo.com, German translations have been added for the text displayed in the sections of the _Teachers_ menu. They can be edited in the _Settings â€“ Login_ Strapi entry by switching to the German locale.
