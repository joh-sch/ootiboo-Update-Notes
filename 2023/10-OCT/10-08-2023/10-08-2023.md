### Integrating teachers.ootiboo.com with revised site architecture

Recent changes to the site architecture, specifically the routing and templating of pages, require that pages of the teachers.ootiboo context are integrated with the way pages of all other contexts (play.ootiboo, international.ootiboo, works.ootiboo) are being rendered. That is, from a unified Strapi collection from which page data can be fetched and routed into the appropriate page template.

Routing: Routing is the process of identifying the URL a user has entered, determining which Strapi page entry this URL corresponds to and finally where the URL, accompanied by the information about ..., should lead, i.e. which frontend page template should be used to display the content corresponding to the URL.

Templating: Templating refers to the creation and implementation of re-usable bundles of code which, when being provided with some valid data from the Strapi backend, will render and display this content, in a desired shape and form, usually specified in a design file/mockup.

### Context-aware link coloring for international.ootiboo.com and ootiboo.com

Context-specific coloring of links (blue for play, international and the welcome/landing page, yellow for works, turquoise for teachers) has been integrated w/ international.ootiboo.com and ootiboo.com.

<br>

### Multi-language content for _Imprint_, _Privacy Policy_ and _Terms & Conditions_

In order to integrate the secondary pages _Imprint_ and _Privacy Policy_ into the international.ootiboo.com build, multi-language content has been enabled for both single content types, _Page Imprint_ and _Page Privacy Policy_. 

For both pages, German content can now be inserted by switching the locale being edited. Both pages‚Äôs German content has been filled in with the English content and still needs to be translated.

<br>

Furthermore, multi-language content has been enabled for the collection type _Terms & Conditions_. None of the collections entries have been translated either, the frontend will fetch the English content by default until they have.

<br>

With multi-language content enabled for all secondary pages, they can safely be added to the _Footers_ entry of international.ootiboo.com (in both language versions/locales).

### Notification Settings

The lists of email addresses notifications are being send out to can now be edited in Strapi.

The new _Notification Settings_ collection contains entries for each email notification currently being send by the platform frontend; each entry features a _Recipients_ field which is an editable list of email addresses. 

Furthermore, each settings entry features a _Send email notification?_ and _Send slack notification?_ toggle field with which either type of notification send on the corresponding event can be switched on/off.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The _Recipients_ field must contain at least on entry for the configuration to be valid. If the configuration for a notification is invalid or does not exist, it will be send to info@ootiboo.com by default.

<br>

#### _Default_ Settings

The _Contact Form Submission_ entry is a default, meaning it provides settings to be used when no settings have been provided to a given instance of the contact form component. The _Recipients_ field can be overwritten in every instance of the contact form (which is a dynamic content block) by filling the block‚Äôs _Recipients_ field. If left empty, the default settings will be used.

### Project card badges overlapping filter buttons

The gap btw. the project card grid and the project filterbar on the project overview page template has been adjusted to prevent project badges (National Curriculum, Children‚Äôs University) from overlapping any of the filter buttons.

<img width="100%" src="https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/87b83f6d-2e07-4ad5-9cc8-3efd56049c24">

<br>

### Project card badges visible above nav. menu elements and page transparency cover

The site architecture has been revised to prevent project card badge elements from being pushed into a visual layer sitting above any of the navigation menu elements (main menu, teachers menu and page switch menu) and the page cover (transparency layer lowering the opacity of page elements while a menu is open).

<img width="100%" src="https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/a02f74ed-1c5a-42ff-abb6-ac054efd4eab">

<br>

### News grid

The card grid component used on the _News & Events_ has been reverted to a version that leaves whitespace btw. grid elements but respects the chronological order of the news items displayed. The newest card grid implementation did not in all cases respect the desired card order and is thus not suited for situations like a news page in which total adherence to an item order is important.

<img width="100%" src="https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/0f07d6e2-f529-4c1f-a9e2-639001af668b">

<br>

### Unnecessary whitespace on project pages

The project page template has been revised to prevent unnecessary whitespace to be rendered between the top page content and the bottom/subpage content (above/below subpage tab switch buttons).

<img width="100%" src="https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/27d6d0d8-69af-429b-bde5-183564059ada">

<br>

### Integration of _Dates & Events_ cards with teachers.ootiboo.com

The integration/rendering of _Dates & Events_ cards in the _Teachers_ context has been revised to prevent clicking on a card from directing the user to a non-existent page (_Page not found_). _Dates & Events_ cards are programmed to link to whatever project the respective event is related to; project pages do not exist in the _Teachers_ context, thus, when an event card is being displayed on teachers.ootiboo.com, it does not function as a project page link.

<img width="100%" src="https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/d9faaf82-17e7-40fd-bd76-05e8b56ea6e1">

<br>

###  Mobile _Dates & Events_ card layout revision

The mobile/responsive _Dates & Events_ card layout has been revised to display the entire card content in a single-column layout. This prevents elements sitting side-by-side in the desktop version from taking up too much space on narrow screens and becoming illegible or being pushed off the screen.

<br>

### Mobile filterbar layout revision

The layout of the card list/grid filter bar has been revised to better fit on mobile screens. In the previous iteration, the filterbar had been organised into groups of buttons layed out in columns; this layout does not work on mobile screens as each column becomes too narrow to fit the buttons. The revised mobile version is layed out in rows, giving each button group the entire page width to fit the buttons.

<br>

### Project resource download form revision

The download form for project resources has been revised to resolve the problem of the form not being recognized as valid (valid = it can be submitted) despite all form fields being filled in. 

In a previous iteration, the automatically filled in values of the _Which year group?_ and the _Which term?_ dropdown fields (by default, the first value of a drop down field is selected automatically upon opening the form) were not being recognized as such by the form component and had to be manually selected by the user in order for the form to become valid. 

<img src="https://github.com/joh-sch/ootiboo-Update-Notes/assets/39758027/93505516-f6b8-4bde-8f8f-26737c6ede14">

<br>

The revised version recognizes pre-filled fields and, in addition, displays appropriate error messages when the submit button is being clicked without all form fields having been filled in.

<br>

### German translation for project page sidebar labels

Labels displayed on items in the project page sidebar component now show the appropriate German translation when switching to the page‚Äôs German version (applies to international.ootiboo.com).
