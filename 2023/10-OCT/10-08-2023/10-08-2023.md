### Integrating teachers.ootiboo.com with revised site architecture

Recent changes to the site architecture, specifically the routing and templating of pages, require that pages of the teachers.ootiboo context are integrated with the way pages of all other contexts (play.ootiboo, international.ootiboo, works.ootiboo) are being rendered. That is, from a unified Strapi collection from which page data can be fetched and routed into the appropriate page template.

Routing: Routing is the process of identifying the URL a user has entered, determining which Strapi page entry this URL corresponds to and finally where the URL, accompanied by the information about ..., should lead, i.e. which frontend page template should be used to display the content corresponding to the URL.

Templating: Templating refers to the creation and implementation of re-usable bundles of code which, when being provided with some valid data from the Strapi backend, will render and display this content, in a desired shape and form, usually specified in a design file/mockup.

### Multi-language content for _Imprint_, _Privacy Policy_ and _Terms & Conditions_

In order to integrate the secondary pages _Imprint_ and _Privacy Policy_ into the international.ootiboo.com build, multi-language content has been enabled for both single content types, _Page Imprint_ and _Page Privacy Policy_. 

For both pages, German content can now be inserted by switching the locale being edited. Both pages‚Äôs German content has been filled in with the English content and still needs to be translated.

<br>

Furthermore, multi-language content has been enabled for the collection type _Terms & Conditions_. None of the collections entries have been translated either, the frontend will fetch the English content by default until they have.

<br>

With multi-language content enabled for all secondary pages, they can safely be added to the _Footers_ entry of international.ootiboo.com (in both language versions/locales).

### Notification Settings

The lists of email addresses notifications are being send out to can now be edited in Strapi.

The new _Notification Settings_ collection contains entries for each email notification currently being send by the platform frontend; each entry features a _Recipients_ field which is an editable list of email addresses. 

Furthermore, each settings entry features a _Send email notification?_ and _Send slack notification?_ toggle field with which either type of notification send on the corresponding event can be switched on/off.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The _Recipients_ field must contain at least on entry for the configuration to be valid. If the configuration for a notification is invalid or does not exist, it will be send to info@ootiboo.com by default.

#### _Default_ Settings

The _Contact Form Submission_ entry is a default, meaning it provides settings to be used when no settings have been provided to a given instance of the contact form component. The _Recipients_ field can be overwritten in every instance of the contact form (which is a dynamic content block) by filling the block‚Äôs _Recipients_ field. If left empty, the default settings will be used.
